# Install Lefthook (worktree-local in worktrees, default in main) and inject the staged-config guard.
#
# Design split — main repo vs. worktree (preserves PR #750's worktree-local design):
#
# * Main repo (git-common-dir == git-dir): the previous version of this script wrote
#   `extensions.worktreeConfig=true` + `--worktree core.hooksPath=<git-dir>/hooks` on every
#   direnv reload. In the main repo this points to the same `.git/hooks` git already
#   resolves by default, so it was redundant — but it tripped lefthook 2.1+'s
#   "core.hooksPath is set locally" guard, forcing `--force` and two warning lines on
#   every reload. We now unset that redundant value (only when it matches the default,
#   preserving any deliberate user override) and call `lefthook install` without --force.
#
# * Worktree (git-common-dir != git-dir): PR #750 deliberately installs hooks under
#   the worktree-local `.git/worktrees/<name>/hooks/` directory via
#   `--worktree core.hooksPath`. That is *not* git's default resolution — git would
#   otherwise route every worktree through the shared `.git/hooks/` and let any
#   nearby worktree's `lefthook install` silently overwrite the staged-config guard
#   we inject below. We preserve that worktree-local design here and keep `--force`
#   because lefthook's guard fires on the (intentional) core.hooksPath override.
#
# Source-of-truth scope: this script governs lefthook install + guard injection for
# the main repo and every worktree whose flake.nix shellHook calls
# `bash ./scripts/ai/install-lefthook-hooks.sh`. Worktrees with inline shellHook
# implementations (`.claude/worktrees/issue_587/flake.nix` 등 8개) are outside this
# scope and tracked as NG-1 (follow-up consolidation candidate). The lefthook.yml
# `lefthook-guard-self-check` job is a second-layer regression defense that catches
# silent guard removal by any worktree at commit-time.
